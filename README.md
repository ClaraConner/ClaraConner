## Hi I am Clara :)
> I am an undergraduate junior studying Software Engineering with a minor in Spanish.
\
I have the most experience with Web Development, but I am also gaining more experience with Python and Machine Learning.
\
*In my free time, you can find me caring for my plants 🪴 trying new recipes 🍳 or working on a variety of crafts 🧶🎨*
\
The main repositories I frequent, are those I manage for ACM Projects at UTD and the WEHack Website and Portal page I help to develop!
\
Enjoy some stats on my GitHub and feel free to explore! ✨
